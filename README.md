## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cartoonify-image.git
   cd cartoonify-image
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open `cartoonify_image.ipynb` and follow the instructions to upload an image and generate its cartoon version.

3. Adjust parameters as needed in the notebook to customize the cartoon effect.
